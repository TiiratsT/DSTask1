The code can be run in /dist folder with command `subtask7.exe input-file.txt`. The nodes are implemented as threads, 
each thread has its id, successor id, next successor id and shortcuts.

As we found out that our third team member Simon Inkin promised to deliver us this exercise, but it turned out that because
of his mental situation it is not possible. Therefore we had to quickly adapt and find a partial solution that might 
work. There program can read the input file, check if all the nodes are correct and give warning if not. It also creates
nodes and gives them their successors. I implemented shortcut command as well, but the others are unimplemented. Shortcut
file also checks if the nodes are there or not.
